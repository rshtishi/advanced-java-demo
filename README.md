1- Install Java

2- Java Execution Workflow

3- recapitulate concepts from java begginers course
	- data types, variables, constants, operators, casting
	- string class
	- conditional statements, visibility
	- loops
	- arrays
	- oop (class, object, state, behaviour)
	- fields, methods, constructors, packages, imports
	- varargs
	- static fields, methods and classes
	
4- Install Maven

5- OOP: inheritance, composition, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction
	- inheritance
	- overriding toString,hashcode and equals
	- virtual method invocation
	
6- Abstract classes and methods, Interfaces, Inner Classes, Anonymous Classes
	- Intefaces VS Abstract classes
	- Inner Classes
	- Local Inner Classes
	- Anonymous Classes
	
7- Enumerations

8- Exceptions
	- Checked Exception Vs Unchecked Exception

13- Concurrent and Parallel programming
	- Running code in parallel (extending thread class, implement runnable interface) [E.g. Concurrency Example 1,2]
	- Sleep, Interupt, Join [E.g. Concurrency Example 3,4]
	- synchronized, reentrant lock [E.g. Concurrency Example 5]
	- Executor, ExecutorService, Executors [E.g. Concurrency Example 6,7]
	- Concurrent Collection Queue [Concurrency Example 8]
	- Concurrent List, Set(CopyOnWrite) [Concurrency Example 9]
	- Concurrent Skip List Set [Concurrent Example 10]
	- Concurrent Hash Map and Concurrent Skip List Map [Example11]
	- Race condition 
	- Producer Consumer problem
