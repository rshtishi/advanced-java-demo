Around our flag we stand united,
With one wish and one intention.
A sacred oath upon it we accord,
Faith for our pardon we blazon.
From battle only he abstaineth,
For who is born a traitor.
He who a true man frighten’d not,
But to the cause dieth a warrior.

With weapons in our hands aflash’d,
Our fatherland we shall defend.
Our sacred rights we shall cede not,
On our land the foe hath a place not.
 For God himself proclaim’d:
Nations of earth shall abate,
And yet Albania will live and succeed.
For thee, for thee we fight.

O Banner, banner, thou symbol hallow’d
Upon thee we now swear.
For Albania, our dear fatherland,
For thy glory and honour.
 Brave man nam’d and honour’d,
The one who died for the fatherland.
Forever shall he be remember’d
On earth and under as a saint!
